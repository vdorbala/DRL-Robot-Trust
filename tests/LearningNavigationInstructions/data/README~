The data files released here are based on the corpus collected by Matt MacMahon (matt@macmahon.org) as described in his AAAI 2006 paper:

Original instructor/follower data can be downloaded from his website:

--------------------------------------------------

While the original data contained follower data for individual subjects, we have combined them together to form a canonical path for each instruction.  This is done in attempt to represent what most followers did following a particular instruction.  Notice that this path may not always lead to the intended destination.

The original instructions were collected in paragraph form that consists of 5 sentences on average, this data is included in Paragraph.xml.  We have also segmented this data into individual sentences, included in SingleSentence.xml.  During the segmentation process, we attempted to align a reasonable action trace to each sentence.  However, Some instructions that could not be aligned were discarded.

--------------------------------------------------

The data files have the following format:

id: The ID of the example.  There are some gaps because there are some additional examples (as mentioned in Matt's dissertation) that we have not yet processed.

map: The name of the map.  This could be one of 3 values (Grid, L, or Jelly)

start and end (Paragraph only): The starting location and intended destination (x,y) used in the data collection process.  Notice the path does not always end up in the intended destination.

instruction file name: The file name of the original data file.  This contains identification information of the instructor, the map used,and the numbered (1-7) locations used in Matt's experiments.

path: A sequence of positions (x, y, orientation) that represents how a human is likely to act following the given instruction.  Please refer to the maps for legal x, y coordinates.  There are 5 possible orientations (0, 90, 180, 270, -1).  A value of -1 means the orientation is unspecified which happens at the beginning of every paragraph.  This is because Matt randomized the orientation during data collection.
