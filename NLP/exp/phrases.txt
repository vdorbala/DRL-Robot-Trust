         go all the way to the end of the hall and this is 4
      
         You will follow the regular concrete path toward the blue tiled flooring one segment
      
         This 'T' intersection is position 3
      
         Go towards the chair at the end of the hall
      
         next, take a right and follow the path until you reach a black easel, this is position 2
      
         Place your back against the wall of the 'T' intersection
      
         Turn left
      
         Go forward one segment to the intersection containing the chair
      
         Turn right
      
         Go forward two segments to the intersection with the brick hall, passing the easel
      
         Turn left
      
         Go forward one segment
      
         with your back to the wall turn right
      
         you see a sofa and then a hat rack
      
         move to the hat rack and turn left
      
         move to the corner you see in front of you
      
         Place your back against the wall of the 'T' intersection
      
         Turn right
      
         Go forward two segments to the intersection of the yellow-tiled hall
      
         Turn left
      
         Go forward three segments to the end of the hall
      
         only one way to go
      
         walk to the end of the yellow hall, 3 steps
      
         turn right
      
         walk to the end of the black hall, 3 steps
      
         turn left
      
         walk forward once
      
         turn right
      
         walk forward once
      
         go straight towards the chair
      
         at the chair, go left onto the blue path
      
         follow this until the end of the hall
      
         here, go left towards the easel
      
         go past the easel to the end of the hall and go left onto the red brick path
      
         the next intersection will be 1
      
         move to the end of green octagon flooring to the stone floor
      
         turn right and move to the stool
      
         turning right you see a chair and in front of you a sofa chair
      
         Go toward the intersection containing the lamp
      
         After moving the one segment to reach this spot, turn left
      
         Go forward one segment to the intersection with the wooden-floored hall
      
         Turn right
      
         Go forward two segments along the wooden-floored hall to the intersection containing the easel
      
         Turn left
      
         Go forward one segment to the blue-tiled hall
      
         Turn toward the end of the hall that intersects the yellow-tiled hall
      
         I believe this is a right turn an dthat the intersection is two segments down
      
         When you reach the yellow-tiled hall, you wil turn away from the end which intersects the stone hall and follow the yellow-tiled hall to that end
      
         If these directions fail, Position 4 is at end of the yellow-tiled hall farthest from the intersection with the stone hall
      
         position 1 is in the red brick hall
      
         Face away from the dead end
      
         Go forward one segment to the interesection containing the stool
      
         Turn left
      
         Go forward two segments, passing the chair
      
         Turn left
      
         You are now facing the yellow-tiled hall
      
         Go foward one segment to the intersection with the stone hall
      
         There is an easel to your left
      
         follow the red brick path away from the bench
      
         at the corner, go right towards the easel
      
         go past the easel to the next corner, and go right again onto the blue path
      
         follow the blue path all the way to the coat rack
      
         at the coat rack, go left onto the yellow path and at the end of this hall is 4
      
         turn so that your back side faces the easel
      
         walk forward once
      
         turn left
      
         walk forward once
      
         turn right
      
         walk forward once
      
         Face the easel
      
         Go forward one segment
      
         Turn left
      
         Go forward one segment to the intersection with the blue-tiled hall
      
         Follow this hall to its opposite end, about seven segments
      
         You will pass a chair and a hatrack
      
         At the far end, you will reach the intersection with the yellow-tiled hall
      
         Turn left
      
         Go forward two segments to the end of the hall
      
         at six put your back to the easel
      
         walk forward one alley and turn left
      
         the carpet should be flowers
      
         move along the flowers past the hatrack and one alley past the lamp
      
         the alley to the right has grey floor
      
         there is only one direction to walk
      
         go forward once
      
         turn left
      
         walk forward twice
      
         there should be an orange floor to the left
      
         turn left
      
         walk forward once
      
         turn right
      
         walk forward once
      
         if you can only see pictures of towers in front of you and butterflys on the walls behind you then you are in the right spot
      
         with your back to the wall turn left
      
         move down two blocks til you get to the alley with flowered carpet
      
         turn right
      
         move forward three or four blocks til you get to the green octagon carpet turn left and move forward one block
      
         take the blue path towards the chair all the way to the end of the hall
      
         here, take a left
      
         next, at the easel, take a right to the end of the hall
      
         at the corner, take a left and at the next corner, take a right at the lamp
      
         the end of this hall is 2
      
         turn to face the green hallway
      
         walk forward twice
      
         turn left
      
         walk forward four times
      
         turn to face the black hallway with the easel at the end of it
      
         there should be pictures of butterflys on the walls in front of you and towers in the back
      
         walk forward once
      
         turn right
      
         walk forward twice
      
         position 3 is in the middle of the blue tiled hall with a coat rack at one end and a chair or something at the other end
      
         Face  the easel
      
         Go forward one segment
      
         Turn left
      
         Go forward one segment to the intersection with the blue-tiled hall
      
         Turn right
      
         You will follow the blue-tiled hall past the intersection with the pink-flowered carpet hall, on your left
      
         To your right there will be a bare concrete hall
      
         One segment away there will be an intersection containing a stool in a stone hall
      
         Position 7 is the intersection of a bare concrete hall and the stone hall
      
         There is a stool in this intersection
      
         The most efficient route is probably to your left, if you have your back facing the wall of the 'T' intersection
      
         Go down the blue-tiled floor until you reach a hall with pink-flowered carpet
      
         Turn right into this hall
      
         Follow this hall until you reach a hall with yellow stone flooring
      
         I believe you turn right
      
         Regardless you will turn toward the easel
      
         The space containing the easel is position 2
      
         find the fish hallways
      
         then find the fish hallways with yellow floors
      
         position 4 is a dead end of the yellow floored fish hallway
